# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Purpose of the Analysis


The purpose of this analysis is to use the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, to oversample and undersample the data in order to compare different machine learning models that reduce bias and predict accurate credit risk. In order to achieve this, the ClusterCentroids algorithm and the SMOTEENN algorithm are utilized along with imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.
